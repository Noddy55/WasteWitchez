        <h1>üå∫üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThe Project‚ôªÔ∏è</h1>
        <br></br>
        <p>Waste Witchez is a hub for all things waste at Wellesley‚Äîa site where the Wellesley community can know where and how to dispose of or recycle waste on campus, as well as find clear information on where our waste ends up.</p>
        <p>Many students have expressed confusion over where different types of waste should be disposed of, or how recycling and composting works at Wellesley. Many don‚Äôt trust that their waste actually gets recycled or composted, understandable considering over 67% of waste in the United States either ends up in landfills or incinerated. However, Wellesley can beat this trend! A gap exists between administrative and student knowledge, which has in part led to Wellesley trailing behind peer institutions when it comes to waste. We created Waste Witchez to address this gap and improve waste management and diversion on Wellesley College‚Äôs campus.</p>          
        <p>To solve this problem, we set out to create a one-stop digital resource that provides answers to any and all waste questions. While our website is still in development, we are working with the Office of Sustainability to add a search engine so users can search for specific items and find out how and where they should be disposed of. We‚Äôre also working to expand on the live map to show locations for Wellesley Universal Waste bins, as well as compost and recycling. Check back soon to see more!</p>          
          
        <h1>‚ôªÔ∏èWhy Waste?üóëÔ∏è</h1>  
        <br></br> 
        <p>Waste management is a local issue with a significant and global environmental impact. According to the 2023 ES 300 report, 47% of all waste placed in the trash at Wellesley could be diverted to recycling or anaerobic digestion.  </p>
        <p>Proper disposal of recycle and compost waste is very important because Wellesley removes any compost or recycling bin with even one contaminating item (i.e. a plastic bottle in the paper recycling bin) and moves it to the trash track to be disposed of. </p>
        <p>Wellesley‚Äôs trash is combusted for energy, this process releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. Incineration of trash also releases harmful chemicals/pollutants into the atmosphere including air pollutants which can cause lung and heart diseases, heavy metals such as lead and mercury, and toxic chemicals such as PFAS and dioxins, which can cause cancer and other health problems. These chemicals and pollutants enter the air, water and food supply near incinerators and get into people‚Äôs bodies when they breathe, drink, and eat contaminants.</p>
        <p>By diverting all kinds of waste from landfills through proper recycling and composting, we can significantly reduce the harmful impact of waste on the environment and contribute to climate change mitigation efforts.</p>

        <br></br>
        <p>We were able to take on this project because of PEAC/ES 125H: The Climate Crisis (+ Hope), an interdisciplinary class that tackles climate change from a systems perspective and culminates in a group project. We want to thank our professors Amy Banzaert, Cordutza Morari, and Jay Turner for offering this class and all their guidance and support.</p>
